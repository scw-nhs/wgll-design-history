## WGLL design history

This site records how the What Good Looks Like rapid prototype has iterated over the course of the alpha (October-December 2025), by a cross-functional user-centred team from [NHS SCW CSU](https://www.scwcsu.nhs.uk/).

It's built using the [x.govuk NHS.UK plug-in for Eleventy](https://x-govuk.github.io/nhsuk-eleventy-plugin/).
