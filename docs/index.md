## About this project
The NHS What Good Looks Like (WGLL)framework was published in 2021. It has since provided a framework for NHS service transformation and improvement, for example supporting digital maturity and cyber assessments. Read more about the background to WGLL.

In September 2025, a cross-functional digital team was tasked to review, refine and revise WGLL, aligning it to Governmentâ€™s three shifts and setting an overarching approach for digitisation.

This site records the discovery findings, different versions of the rapid prototype and the thinking and research that informed the changes.
