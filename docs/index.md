## About this project
The [NHS What Good Looks Like (WGLL) framework](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/digitise-connect-transform/what-good-looks-like/what-good-looks-like-publication/) was published in 2021. It has since provided a framework for NHS service transformation and improvement, for example supporting digital maturity and cyber assessments.

In September 2025, a cross-functional digital team was tasked to review, refine and revise WGLL, aligning it to Government’s three shifts and setting an overarching approach for digitisation.

This site records the discovery findings, different versions of the rapid prototype and the thinking and research that informed the changes.
