## Background to this work

The team will review, refine and revise the What Good Looks Like (WGLL) framework content, working out what's changed, bringing it up-to-date with the [Governmentâ€™s three shifts](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/10-year-health-plan-for-england-fit-for-the-future/fit-for-the-future-10-year-health-plan-for-england-executive-summary) and setting an overarching approach for digitisation.

The team will work in three stages - discovery (review/research), alpha (test, learn, iterate) and beta (pilot with users). Deliverables at each stage are:

* Vision statement (discovery)
* Discovery report with full review findings (discovery)
* WGLL users and needs (discovery)
* Working but limited prototype (alpha)
* Participatory co-design workshops and user research with c60 teams of users/stakeholders (alpha)
* New/planned blueprints (alpha)
* Internal self-assessment vs NHS service standards to support approvals from NHSE WGLL sponsor (alpha)
* Redesigned, restructured WGLL content/structure, including redirects and service performance analysis (beta)
* Knowledge transfer, roadmap and guidance (beta)

## Blueprints

Work has already been done on WGLLv2. This version represents a detailed operational guide with specific actions for both ICSs and individual organisations, including implementation steps, governance structures, and links to supporting resources. V2 also expands each success measure into actionable items for ICSs and organisations, whereas V1 presents them as broad thematic goals. The team was asked to look at 5 priority areas for 'blueprint' examples of good practice:

* GPs/Primary care
* EPR implementation and optimisation
* NHS App usage by Trusts and how they support it
* Digitising HR/People services
* Neighbourhood working
