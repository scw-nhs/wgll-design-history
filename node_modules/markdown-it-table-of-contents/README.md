# markdown-it-table-of-contents
A table of contents plugin for Markdown-it. Simple, customizable and with a default slugifier that matches that of [markdown-it-anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-anchor) (>5.0.0).

## Usage

CommonJS:

``` javascript
var MarkdownIt = require("markdown-it");
var md = new MarkdownIt();

md.use(require("markdown-it-anchor").default); // Optional, but makes sense as you really want to link to something, see info about recommended plugins below
md.use(require("markdown-it-table-of-contents"));
```

ESM:
```javascript
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it';
import MarkdownItTOC from 'markdown-it-table-of-contents';

const md = new MarkdownIt();
md.use(MarkdownItTOC);
```

Then add `[[toc]]` where you want the table of contents to be added in your document.

*Want to use a table of contents generator client-side in the browser? Try my `<table-of-contents>` webcomponent: [table-of-contents-element on GitHub](https://github.com/cmaas/table-of-contents-element). Advantage: can use more sophisticated query selector and better support for HTML customization.*

## Example markdown

This markdown:

``` markdown
# Heading

[[toc]]

## Sub heading 1
Some nice text

## Sub heading 2
Some even nicer text
```

... would render this HTML using the default options specified in "usage" above:

``` html
<h1 id="heading">Heading</h1>

<div class="table-of-contents">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#heading">Heading</a>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#sub-heading-1">Sub heading 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#sub-heading-2">Sub heading 2</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="sub-heading-1">Sub heading 1</h2>
<p>Some nice text</p>

<h2 id="sub-heading-2">Sub heading 2</h2>
<p>Some even nicer text</p>
```

## Options

```js
md.use(require("markdown-it-table-of-contents"), options);

`format`               | A function for formatting headings (see below)                                      | `md.renderInline(content)`
`containerHeaderHtml`  | Optional HTML string for container header                                           | `undefined`
`containerFooterHtml`  | Optional HTML string for container footer                                           | `undefined`

`transformLink` is an optional function to transform the link as you like.

```js
function transformLink(link) {
  // transform the link as you like here.
  return transformedLink;
}
```

`transformContainerOpen` and `transformContainerClose` can be used to replace the container element with one or several more like so:

```js
md.use(markdownItTOC, {
  transformContainerOpen: () => {
    return '<nav class="my-toc"><button>Toggle</button><h3>Table of Contents</h3>';
  },
  transformContainerClose: () => {
    return '</nav>';
  }
});
```

**Advanced headline text extraction / manipulation:**

By default (and for historical consistency), formatting in headlines is dropped. If you have this headline:
```md
# Heading with *emphasis* and **bold** and `code` and ![img](test.png)
```
it will be shown as
```html
<li><a href="#heading-with-emphasis-and-bold-and-code-and">Heading with emphasis and bold and code and</a></li>
```
in your TOC. Please note that the alt text of the image is dropped. That is because `getTokensText` filters for `text` and `code_inline` token types only.

If you want to keep formatting in headlines, you can provide a custom `getTokensText` function as an option:

```js
md.use(markdownItTOC, {
  getTokensText: (tokens, rawToken) => {
    return rawToken.content;
  },
  slugify: (text, rawToken) => {
    const s = rawToken.children.map(t => t.content).join('').trim();
    return encodeURIComponent(String(s).trim().toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-'));
  }
});
```
The data flow is as follows: `getTokensText` extracts text from a headline and passes this as first param to `slugify` and `format`. By default, only text elements are extracted and formatting is lost. See the source code to understand how this is done. In the above example, `getTokensText` returns the raw Markdown content of the headline token. The default `format` function receives the raw Markdown as first param and uses `md.renderInline(content)` to keep the formatting. However, the default `slugify` doesn't drop weird characters. You either need to provide your own slugify function or use `rawToken` in `slugify` to filter for text elements only that serve as the slug. It is strongly recommended to use plugins like [markdown-it-anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-anchor) that assign IDs to headlines so that you don't need to use `slugify` at all. If a headline already has an anchor element, `slugify` is never called.

`format` is an optional function for changing how the headings are displayed in the TOC.

By default, TOC headings will be formatted using markdown-it's internal MD formatting rules (i.e. it will be formatted using the same rules / extensions as other markdown in your document). You can override this behavior by specifying a custom `format` function. The function should accept two arguments:

1. `content` - The heading text, as a markdown string.
2. `md` â€“ markdown-it's internal markdown parser object. This should only be need for advanced use cases.

```js
function format(content, md) {
  // manipulate the headings as you like here.
  return manipulatedHeadingString;
}
```

## Recommended plugins

By default, markdown-it-table-of-contents collects all headings and renders a nested list. It uses the `slugify()` function to create anchor targets for the links in the list. However, the headlines in your markdown document are not touched by markdown-it-table-of-contents. You'd have a nice table of contents, but the links don't link to anything. That's why you need another plugin to generate ids (anchor link targets) for all of your headlines. There are two recommended plugins to achieve this:

### [markdown-it-anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-anchor)

This plugin transforms all headlines in a markdown document so that the HTML code includes an id. It *slugifies* the headline:

```markdown
## Hello world, I think you should read this article
```

Becomes

```html
<h2 id="hello-world-i-think-you-should-read-this-article">Hello world, I think you should read this article</h2>
```

### [markdown-it-attrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs)

This plugin lets you attach custom attributes to your headlines. This is especially useful, if you have long headlines but want short anchors:

```markdown
## Hello world, I think you should read this article {#hello}
```

Becomes

```html
<h2 id="hello">Hello world, I think you should read this article</h2>
```

## Full example with unusual headline order

Of course, both plugins can be combined. markdown-it-anchor ignores headlines that already have an id attribute.

Furthermore, markdown-it-table-of-contents can handle unusual heading orders. Consider the full example below:

```js
var md = new MarkdownIt();
md.use(markdownItTOC, {
  "includeLevel": [2,3,4]
});
md.use(require("markdown-it-attrs"));
md.use(require("markdown-it-anchor"));
```


```markdown
# Article

[[toc]]

### A message from our sponsors

Ad

## Hello world, I think you should read this article {#hello}

Lorem ipsum

## What's next?

Read this next...

#### See related articles {#related}
```

HTML output:

```html
<h1 id="article">Article</h1>
<p>
  <div class="table-of-contents">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#a-message-from-our-sponsors">A message from our sponsors</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#hello">Hello world, I think you should read this article</a></li>
      <li><a href="#what's-next%3F">What's next?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#related">See related articles</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</p>
<h3 id="a-message-from-our-sponsors">A message from our sponsors</h3>
<p>Ad</p>
<h2 id="hello">Hello world, I think you should read this article</h2>
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>
<h2 id="what's-next%3F">What's next?</h2>
<p>Read this next...</p>
<h4 id="related">See related articles</h4>
```

## Example for omitting headlines from the TOC

If you want to exclude single headlines, you can use a special HTML comment to omit the next headline from the TOC:

```markdown
<!-- omit from toc -->
# Title
```

For this to work, the HTML comment must come right in the line before the headline you want to exclude. Furthermore, you need to allow HTML in MarkdownIT:

```js
const md = new MarkdownIt({ html: true });
```

You can override the HTML comment by using the option `omitTag` as explained above. Both, the tag and the actual comment in the Markdown file are case-insensitive.

## Additional infos

* This plugin outputs a semantically correct table of contents. Sub-lists are rendered within the parent `<li>` tag and not as a separate (empty) `<li>`.
* Headlines can be in an arbitrary order. For example, h3, h2, h4. Please note that the jump from h2 to h4 causes a doube-indentation, which is correct.
